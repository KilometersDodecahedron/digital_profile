      <!-- lyrics to "Indestructable" by Disturbed -->
      Another mission,
      the powers have called me away.
      Another time,
      to carry the colors again.
      My motivation,
      an oath I've sworn to defend.
      To win the honor
      of coming back home again.
      No explanation
      will matter after we begin.
      Unlock the dark destroyer that's buried in me.
      My true vocation.
      And now my unfortunate friend,
      you will discover
      a war you're unable to win.
      I'll have you know,
      that I've become
      Indestructible.
      Determination that is incorruptible.
      From the other side,
      a terror to behold.
      Annihilation will be unavoidable.
      Every broken enemy will know
      that their opponent had to be invincible.
      Take a last look around while you're alive.
      I'm an indestructible master of war.
      Another reason,
      another cause for me to fight.
      Another fuse uncovered
      now, for me to light.
      My dedication
      to all that I've sworn to protect.
      I carry out my orders
      with not a regret.
      A declaration
      embedded deep under my skin.
      A permanent reminder
      of how we began.
      No hesitation
      when I am commanding the strike.
      You need to know
      that you're in for the fight of your life.
      You will be shown
      how I've become
      Indestructible.
      Determination that is incorruptible.
      From the other side,
      a terror to behold.
      Annihilation will be unavoidable.
      Every broken enemy will know
      that their opponent had to be invincible.
      Take a last look around while you're alive.
      I'm an indestructible master of war.
      I'm
      Indestructible.
      Determination that is incorruptible.
      From the other side,
      a terror to behold.
      Annihilation will be unavoidable.
      Every broken enemy will know
      that their opponent had to be invincible.
      Take a last look around while you're alive.
      I'm an indestructible master of war.
      Indestructible.
      Determination that is incorruptible.
      From the other side,
      a terror to behold.
      Annihilation will be unavoidable.
      Every broken enemy will know
      that their opponent had to be invincible
      Take a last look around while you're alive.
      I'm an indestructible master of war.

      <!-- lyrics to "Straight Through the Sun" by Spiderbait -->
      I was born from the flames of a raging fire.
      A hundred feet high.
      One May morning.
      
      Then I changed to a bird took to the sky.
      Flew for ten
      thousand miles.
      
      Now I'm going
      at the speed
      of light.
      Straight through the sun.
      
      Now I'm moving beyond all space and time.
      I've been alive
      for ten thousand years.
      
      Straight.
      I'm going
      at the speed
      of light.
      Straight through the sun.
      
      Straight through the sun.
